## Welcome the HaveMetal Project

HaveMetal project was initially nothing but a concept idea, like a dream, that eventually came across with a real life application.
The main goal of this project is to teach machines how to read engineer drawings the same way humans beings do, using deep learning models and a specific device with scan capabilities (Google Glass is a strong candidate).
