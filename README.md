## Welcome the HaveMetal Project (Ionic 3)

## This project no longer works due to its old ionic version

HaveMetal project was initially nothing but a concept idea that eventually came across with a real life application.
The main goal of this project is to teach machines how to read engineer drawings the same way humans beings do, using deep learning models and a specific device with scan capabilities.

After downloading the image, the following command will crate and run a container with the image:

`sudo docker run -it -p 80:8100 -p 35729:35729 -d jrkrauss/havemetal`
